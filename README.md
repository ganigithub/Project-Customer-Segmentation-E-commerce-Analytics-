E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers. One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. by segmenting the existing customers based on their purchasing pattern.

In this project, I will analyze and segment the customers of an E-commerce company. This will enable the E-commerce company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies.

- The approach I used to segment customers with similar purchasing pattern is RFM Approach.
  - Recency    : How recent a customer is ?
  - Frequency : what is the number of visits of customer ?
  - Monetary  : How much money a customer spent ?
- The algorithm I used to categorize customers is popular Unsupervised ML aglorithm K-Means Clustering.
- Before modeling lot of pre-processing and feature engineering was done to make data more suitable for the model and get valuable insights.
- At the end customers were put in categories with similar purchase pattern which will help organization to take better decision in future regarding improving their relationship with their customers.
