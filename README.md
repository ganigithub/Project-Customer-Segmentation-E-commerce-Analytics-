In this project, I will analyze and segment the customers of an E-commerce company. This will enable the e-commerce company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies.

- The approach I used to segment customers with similar purchasing pattern is RFM Approach (Recency, Frequency & Monetary).
- The algorithm I used to categorize customers is popular Unsupervised ML aglorithm K-Means Clustering.
